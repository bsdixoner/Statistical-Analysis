Statistical Analysis is a Drupal 6 module aimed at providing a site administrator and its users with a way to identify interactions in an easy to use interface.

Installation of the module is like any other Drupal module (sites/all/modules/.).

For the module to work best it is best to have the following other modules installed (NOT required):
- Activity
- Facebook_status
- Votingapi
- Tagadelic
- Community_tags
- Taxonomy
- Charts
- Open_flash_chart_api

These additional modules further add information to the statistics shown to the user and administrator.
